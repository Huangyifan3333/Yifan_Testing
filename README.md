 This is the showcase of ATSC3.0 channel coding presentation, which mainly intrduced the comparison among 
 ATSC3.0 channel encoding and decoding and other previous protocol standard. The throughput is evaluated by BER graph 
 in terms of different decoding technics. 
 The Matlab codes were not included in this branch, if anyone is interested to discuss about this project, please contact author as following:
